## Hi there 👋

# Welcome to the Lab of Mayhem


##  About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student with a **Machine Learning major** and a mild obsession with:
-  **Motorsports** (F1 addict, anything that runs on four wheels...)

## 🏁 Highlight Projects

### 🧩 Race Strategy Optimizer [![repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub--black?logo=github)](https://github.com/abubakar-ahmed/Race_Staregy_Optimizer_MLOP)
> Neural network that tells your tires when to quit whining.

- Predicts tire compounds like a virtual race engineer.
- Real-time API + web app interface.
- Retraining pipeline + simulated traffic stress test.

### 🧠 Optimal Tire Compound Selector [![repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub--black?logo=github)](https://github.com/abubakar-ahmed/Tire-Wear-Prediction-App)
> Because making the wrong pit call is a crime.

- ML classification model trained on driving style, weather, and track surface.
- Outputs ideal tire compound — slick, soft, or strategy-blunder.
- Clean FastAPI interface + retrainable model setup.
