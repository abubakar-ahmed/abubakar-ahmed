## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student with a **Machine Learning major** and a mild obsession with:
- 🏎️ **Motorsports** (F1 addict, anything that runs on four wheels...)
- ⚙️ **AI in Performance Engineering**
- 🧪 Turning data chaos into machine-learned brilliance
- 🧠 I build models that learn faster than I did in my first semester.

Currently manifesting a future where I fuse ML with motorsports engineering. If it smells like burning rubber and runs on tensors, I’m in.

## 🔥 My Favorite Weapons

| 🛠️ Tech | 🚦 Used For |
|--------|-------------|
| `Python` | ML pipelines, LSTMs, CNNs |
| `NumPy` & `Pandas` | Data wrangling sorcery |
| `TensorFlow/Keras` | Brain-building with silicon neurons |
| `FastAPI` | Serving predictions faster than an undercut |
| `Flutter` | Cross-platform UIs with flair |
| `MongoDB` | Stashing race data like team secrets |

## 🏁 Highlight Projects

### 🧩 Race Strategy Optimizer [![repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub--black?logo=github)](https://github.com/abubakar-ahmed/Race_Staregy_Optimizer_MLOP)
> Neural network that tells your tires when to quit whining.

- Predicts tire compounds like a virtual race engineer.
- Real-time API + web app interface.
- Retraining pipeline + simulated traffic stress test.

### 🌫️ PM2.5 Time Series Forecasting
> Breathing air shouldn't be a gamble — so I built a model for it.

- LSTM-based forecast on Beijing air quality dataset.
- Interpolation, scaling, sequence generation, all in a clean Jupyter Notebook.
- Tuned like a V6 hybrid.

### 🧠 Optimal Tire Compound Selector [![repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub--black?logo=github)](https://github.com/abubakar-ahmed/Tire-Wear-Prediction-App)
> Because making the wrong pit call is a crime.

- ML classification model trained on driving style, weather, and track surface.
- Outputs ideal tire compound — slick, soft, or strategy-blunder.
- Clean FastAPI interface + retrainable model setup.

---

## 📚 Current Grind

- 💡 Building **hybrid ML + DL models** for text classification that judge tweets with algorithmic precision.
- 🧪 Experimenting with transformer-based models — because LSTMs are great, but attention *is* all you need.
- 🧠 Reading too many papers and rewriting the same pipeline until it’s perfect (or at least doesn’t crash).
- 🎯 Ultimate goal: **inject ML into motorsports R&D**, automate race strategies, and someday earn a seat (or a laptop) in a race team’s data bunker.

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- Favorite racer is Daniel Ricciardo....
- I’ve made an app to predict tire wear. Yes. It works. (Sorta.)
- Can talk about cars longer than tire life itself.       
- 🎧 My playlist for coding sessions is 90% sad songs and 10% classical music — mostly on shuffle to be honest.
